# Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

Used the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities. 

Built a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS and stores persistent data in the localstorage.
